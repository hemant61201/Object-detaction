<h2>Cookies used</h2>
The cookies used on this site are there to measure how you use the website (using Google Analytics) so we can improve it.

This site runs Google analytics, which uses four cookies for tracking visitors to the site.

These cookies store information about what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
No data specific to any identifiable user is retained, and we do not share our data with any other Google services.
With the values gained from these cookies Google Analytics can interpret journeys through our website content, give us information about how people use our site and so present an opportunity to improve it.
Google Analytics information about privacy and cookies may be found at https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html and https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies
As a user you may opt out of the process Google Analytics uses to collect traffic log data (should your web browser be compatible). Google provides a browser add-on that enables a user to opt out of receiving Google Analytics cookies - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
<h2>Functionality lost by disabling cookies</h2>
